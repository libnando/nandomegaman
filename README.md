### ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone!

About me:

Web developer for over 12 years. Extremely in love with this universe (web) that allows us to expand our creativity infinitely. ðŸ’–

Regarding server languages, i've played a lot with php / yii framework, including being a very active member creator of extensions with thousands of downloads from the community. =)

For the last 7 years I've been using dotnet platform (c# / aspnet mvc/core) to create cute applications with DDD (domain driven design) structuring. I participate in software events, I follow microsoft MVPs via social media, I always try to keep myself updated on the platform's evolution, directly reflecting on the applications I'm involved with.

I have a blog (https://libnando.com), for moments when i decide to philosophize... i also play with some projects on github.
